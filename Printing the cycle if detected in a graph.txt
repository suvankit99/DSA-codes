Printing the cycle if detected in a graph . 

mark cycle start and cycle end and store parent of each node in a parent array .

Then using parent array reconstruct the cycle . 

Ex => 

 // Printing the cycle
    vector<int> cycle;
    for (int v = cycleEnd; v != cycleStart; v = parent[v])
    {
        cycle.push_back(v);
    }
    cycle.push_back(cycleStart);
    reverse(cycle.begin(), cycle.end());
    cout << "Cycle = ";
    for (auto it : cycle)
        cout << it << " ";
